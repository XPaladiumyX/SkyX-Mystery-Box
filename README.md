  2. Place the ``.jar`` file into the ``/plugins/`` directory of your server.

## üìã Configuration  
The plugin is fully configurable via the ``config.yml`` file, allowing you to define as many custom Mystery Boxes as you like.  
  
Example ``config.yml``:  
```
mystery_boxes:
  basic_box:
    name: "&aBasic Mystery Box"
    material: PLAYER_HEAD
    texture: "base64_texture_code_here"
    lore:
      - "&7Right-click to open!"
      - "&fContains common rewards."
    rewards:
      common:
        chance: 70
        items:
          - "IRON_INGOT:10"
          - "GOLD_INGOT:5"
        command:
          - "tell %player% you have been rewarded"
          - "iagive %player% arcanite:arcanite_helmet 1"
      rare:
        chance: 30
        items:
          - "DIAMOND:2"
        command:
          - "give %player% minecraft:diamond_sword 1"
  epic_box:
    name: "&dEpic Mystery Box"
    material: PLAYER_HEAD
    texture: "another_base64_texture_code"
    lore:
      - "&6Right-click to reveal epic loot!"
      - "&fHigher chance for rare items!"
    rewards:
      rare:
        chance: 50
        items:
          - "ENCHANTED_BOOK:1:sharpness,4"
      legendary:
        chance: 10
        items:
          - "NETHERITE_INGOT:1"
        command:
          - "give %player% minecraft:netherite_sword 1"
          - "say %player% just got an epic item!"
```
### Key Configuration Options:  
  - name: Name of the Mystery Box (can be customized).  
  - material: The item that represents the box (e.g., PLAYER_HEAD).  
  - texture: Base64-encoded texture for the custom head.  
  - lore: Description shown when viewing the Mystery Box.  
  - rewards: Configurable rewards with chances:  
      - items: List of items to give, can include quantity.  
      - command: List of commands to execute when opening the box.
  
## üéÅ Example of Random Loot  
  - **Common Reward:** 70% chance to get 10 Iron Ingots or 5 Gold Ingots, plus a message or a custom item like a helmet.  
  - **Rare Reward:** 30% chance to get 2 Diamonds and a special item (like a custom sword).  
  - **Epic Reward:** 10% chance to get 1 Netherite Ingot and a Netherite Sword with a server-wide announcement.  
 
## üõ†Ô∏è Commands  
  - ``/givemysterybox <player> <box_id>``  
    Give a specific Mystery Box to a player (e.g., ``basic_box``, ``epic_box``).  
    
## üõ°Ô∏è Permissions  
  - **mysterybox.use**: Allow a player to consume the Mystery Box (right-click to open).  
  - **mysterybox.give**: Allow a player (or staff) to give Mystery Boxes to others.
    
## üöÄ How it Works  
  1. **Creating Custom Mystery Boxes**:  
    You can easily add new Mystery Boxes to the ``config.yml`` file. Each box can have its own name, texture, lore, and reward configuration.  

  2. **Consuming the Mystery Box**:  
    When a player right-clicks the Mystery Box in their inventory (e.g., a custom head), it is consumed and gives the player a random reward based on the configured chances.  

  3. **Rewards**:  
    The rewards can be a mix of items and executed commands. The plugin gives you full control over how you want to reward players whether through physical loot or custom commands (e.g., give items, announce rewards in chat).  
## üìù Customization  
This plugin gives you complete freedom to:  

  - Customize the appearance of the Mystery Box (via textures).  
  - Define loot chances and what rewards players receive.  
  - Execute custom commands to modify the server experience when opening boxes.  

You can adjust everything in ``config.yml`` without modifying any code, allowing you to easily add more boxes or change their content.
